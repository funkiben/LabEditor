1. Frame for placing components and constructing simulation

2. Drag and drop component feature from Component Picker window to simulation editor window

3. Component inspector window for editing LabComponent fields <- might need to be more than just accessing LabComponent fields (i.e. below task)

3.5 Map out all editable fields with appropriate InputComponent

4. Graduation editing? (graduations aren't a LabComponent...)

5. Menu bar for opening different windows, saving, loading, and exporting

6. Way to run the simulation in the editor?

7. Some sort of way to link LabComponents together (maybe use QT's single slot method?) <- needs equation support too

8. Different tools for editing simulation: move, select, resize

9. Probably will need a new component: dropdown thing that shows other components when clicked, this will make component inspector better organized

10. Window snapping like in Eclipse and Unity?

11. Instruction manual!
