1. Drag and drop component feature from Component Picker window to simulation editor window

2. Make EditableFieldRegistry more robust, i.e. special conditions for inputs that might cause inputs to change under certain situations

2.5 Finish adding in rest of LabComponent's to field registry (DataTable, Graph, and ParticleSystem are last ones I think)

3. Menu bar for opening different windows, saving, loading, and exporting <- make this functional

4. Way to run the simulation in the editor?

5. Some sort of way to link LabComponents together (maybe use QT's single slot method?) <- needs equation support too

6. Different tools for editing simulation: move, select, resize

7. Window snapping like in Eclipse and Unity?

8. Instruction manual!
