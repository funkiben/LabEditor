1. Drag and drop component feature from Component Picker window to simulation editor window

2. Component inspector window for editing LabComponent fields <- might need to be more than just accessing LabComponent fields (i.e. task 4)

2.5 Map out all editable fields with appropriate InputComponent

3. Way to run the simulation in the editor?

4. Some sort of way to link LabComponents together (maybe use QT's single slot method?) <- needs equation support too

5. Different tools for editing simulation: move, select, resize

6. Window snapping like in Eclipse and Unity?

7. Instruction manual!
